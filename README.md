# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of the project was to use the AIRBNB dataset to understand the performance of Airbnb in New York city and what the future might hold for the industry.

## Process
1.	Downloaded the dataset for New York city Airbnb.
2.	Developed different visualization to understand the dataset and how they relate to one another.
3.	Try to find interesting data within the dataset.
4.	Came up with five different questions using appropriate fields and visualization to satisfy my curiosity.
5.	Developed a Dashboard to present my findings.

## Results
I went with Option2 using AIRBNB dataset.
I created visualizations to understand the various correlations and trends within the datasets. The visualization I used to satisfy my curiosity are Line chat which I use to understand how revenue and number of beds have changed over the years. I used bar chart to come up with the top 30 Superhot by pairing the number of reviews and review score ratings. The highlight table was used to visualize the number of properties, by property type and neighbourhood. I used Stacked bars with date function to understand the revenue generated every first month of the year by property type. 
The five question I asked with the dataset are as follows:
1.	What are the most common types of property listings (e.g., apartments, houses, private rooms)?
2.	How has the revenue of Airbnb listings in New York city changed over the years?
3.	Are there any correlations between the revenue generated and factors such as location and number of beds?
4.	Can we identify any super hosts based on their high ratings and number of reviews?
5.	What does the future of Airbnb look like?


## Challenges 
My major challenge was using the data function to  slice the data to a specific period of time.

## Future Goals
My future goal will be to source for more dataset in conjunction with the Airbnb dataset to understand the customer side of the data and how customer make their choices by figuring out what they find mostly important to them when making their decisions on which listing to go with.
